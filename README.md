# discord-league-bot

This bot was created by me on my old desktop computer, but unfortunatley like an idiot, I didn't back the code up because I didn't think I would need it, then factory reset the computer since it was acting slow :D. Here are screenshots of the bot when I was developing it.

Uses a combination of Discord's API and Riot Games API to get userinfo of player's profiles, as well as track their live games.
('Elyeasa' and 'delta jungle' were my online names at the time)
